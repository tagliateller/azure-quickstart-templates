## Solution overview and deployed resources

+	This template will create a SQL Server 2014 IaasExtension Resource to update an existing SQL Server 2014 Virtual Machine

This template setup or update SQL Server Auto Backup setting on any existing Azure Virtual machine with SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition. This service enables you to configure a backup schedule on your SQL Server 2014 Enterprise and Standard Virtual Machines in a very convenient manner while ensuring your data is backed up consistently and safely. Automated Backup is configured to backup all existing and new databases for the default instance of SQL Server. This simplifies the usual process of configuring Managed Backup for new databases and then for each existing database by combining it into one simple automated setup.

If you wish to customize the settings, you can specify the retention period, storage account, and whether you want encryption to be enabled. The retention period, as is standard for Managed Backup, can be anywhere between 1 and 30 days. The storage account defaults to the same storage account as the VM, but can be changed to any other storage account. This provides you with a DR option, allowing you to back up your databases to storage in another datacenter. If you decide to encrypt your backups, an encryption certificate will be generated and saved in the same storage account as the backups. In this scenario, you will also need to enter a password which will be used to protect the encryption certificates used for encrypting and decrypting your backups. This allows you to not worry about your backups beyond the configuration of this feature, and also ensures you can trust that your backups are secure.


## Notable Parameters

|Name|Description|Example|
|:---|:---------------------|:---------------|
|sqlAutobackupRetentionPeriod|Backup retention period in days, 1-30 days|20|
|sqlAutobackupStorageAccountName|What storage account to use for backups|myExistingBackupStoragAccountName|
|sqlAutobackupEncryptionPassword|a password which will be used to protect the encryption certificates used for encrypting and decrypting your backups|Password123|

## Notes

	+ You must provide an existing storage account for the backup.
	+ This backup storage account must be a Standard_LRS storage account.

## SQL Server IaaS Agent

This feature is part of the new component that will be installed on the VM when features are enabled and this component is called SQL Server IaaS Agent. It is built in the form of Azure VM Extension meaning all the Azure VM Extension concepts are applicable making it perfect tool for the management of SQL in Azure VMs on scale. You can push this IaaS Agent to a number of VMs at once, you can configure, and you can remove or disable it as well.
